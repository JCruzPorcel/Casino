# 🎡 Casino Roulette Project  

## 🎮 First Experience Using Godot  

### 📝 Project Overview  
This prototype is a complete casino roulette game developed as my first experience using **Godot**. I worked on this project in my free time for approximately two weeks. This development was key in determining that Godot would be the main tool for future casino game creations. The game is designed to be modular and independent, allowing for a high degree of customization and flexibility.  

### ✨ Key Features  
- **Modular Design:** All components of the game are independent, making it easy to modify and expand functionality.  
- **Customizable Colors:** Players can select their preferred colors for the roulette board, enhancing personalization.  
- **Game Variants:**  
  - **Double Zero Option:** Players can activate the double zero (00) for a classic casino experience.  
  - **Single Zero Play:** Alternatively, enjoy a game with only a single zero (0).  

### 💡 Experience and Learning  
This project allowed me to explore various aspects of game development in Godot, including:  
- Scene management  
- User interface design  
- Game mechanics and logic  

🎲 Feel free to explore the project and enjoy!
