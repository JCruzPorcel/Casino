# ðŸŽ¡ Casino Roulette Project

## ðŸŽ® First Experience Using Godot

### Project Overview
This prototype is a complete casino roulette game developed as my first experience with Godot. I worked on this project in my free time for approximately two weeks. This prototype was key in determining that Godot would be the main development tool for future casino games. The game is designed to be modular and independent, allowing for a high degree of customization and flexibility.

### Key Features
- **Modular Design:** All components of the game are independent, making it easy to modify and expand the game's functionality.
- **Customizable Colors:** Players can select their preferred colors for the roulette board, enhancing personalization.
- **Game Variants:** 
  - **Double Zero Option:** Players can choose to activate the double zero (00) for a more classic casino experience.
  - **Single Zero Play:** Alternatively, players can enjoy a game with only a single zero (0).

### Experience and Learning
This project allowed me to explore various aspects of game development in Godot, including:
- Scene management
- User interface design
- Game mechanics and logic

Feel free to check out the project and experience the excitement of casino roulette from the comfort of your own home!
